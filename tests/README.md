**1. Writing Test Code (test_webgraph.py)**  
- **Organizing the Test Class:**  
  We place all our test methods in a subclass of `unittest.TestCase`. Each test function’s name typically starts with `test_`, which allows the `unittest` discovery mechanism to find and run it automatically.

- **Focusing on Core Methods:**  
  Our tests target each public function in `webgraph.py`. For instance:
  - `test_add_node()` ensures that adding a node with specific metadata actually stores the node and data correctly in the graph.
  - `test_add_edge()` checks that edges are properly formed between existing nodes.
  - `test_remove_node()` and `test_remove_edge()` verify that nodes and edges are indeed removed, and that no dangling links remain.
  - `test_update_node_metadata()` ensures that metadata updates are reflected in the graph.
  - `test_calculate_pagerank()` and related tests verify that PageRank computations run correctly and that results are retrievable.
  - `test_get_subgraph()` checks that we can extract a subgraph of neighbors from a given node within a certain hop distance.

- **Testing Edge Cases and Exceptions:**  
  We don’t stop at the main logic paths; we also test how the code handles unusual or error conditions. This might include:
  - Attempting to retrieve metadata for a node that doesn’t exist and ensuring the code raises an expected `KeyError`.
  - Calling `get_pagerank()` before we’ve actually calculated PageRank, expecting the code to either return an error or handle that gracefully.
  - Removing a non-existent node or edge, ensuring the operation completes without unexpected crashes.

**2. Adjusting the Implementation (webgraph.py) to Improve Coverage**  
Once we run the tests and generate a coverage report, we might see certain lines of code that are not being tested—indicated as “missing.” For example, some lines might handle very specific error cases or initialization conditions that none of our tests have triggered yet. By analyzing the missing lines, we can add or modify test cases that specifically target those conditions. If the tests reveal that our code does not handle these scenarios gracefully, we can then refine the implementation in `webgraph.py`:

- **Initializing Attributes:**  
  If coverage data shows we’re missing lines in the constructor or initialization code, we may set default values so that there’s always a known state for the test to verify. This ensures that if a test calls `get_pagerank()` before `calculate_pagerank()`, the code won’t fail with an `AttributeError`. Instead, we might raise a `KeyError` or provide a meaningful message.

- **Handling Exceptions and Return Values:**  
  If some branches are never covered—perhaps an `if` condition is never true because we never provided inputs triggering it—we can add tests that force those inputs or adjust `webgraph.py` to consistently handle all code paths. For example, if we have a branch that checks whether a node exists before returning data, we add a test that tries to retrieve data from a non-existent node.

**3. Interpreting the Coverage Report**  
The `coverage report` command gives us useful metrics:

- **Stmts (Statements)**:  
  The total number of executable lines in the file.

- **Miss (Missing)**:  
  How many lines of code were not executed by any test. We want to reduce this number to ensure that every line of code is tested at least once.

- **Cover (Coverage Percentage)**:  
  The percentage of statements executed by tests. A higher coverage percentage means we’re testing more of our code. While aiming for 100% coverage is a good goal, it’s more important to ensure we have meaningful tests rather than just hitting every line arbitrarily.

- **Missing**:  
  This lists the exact line numbers where coverage is missing. These are our clues to write new tests or modify existing ones to cover previously untested scenarios.

**5. Iterative Improvement**  
After adding or modifying tests, we re-run coverage. If we still see missing lines, we repeat the process: inspect the code paths that remain uncovered, add or refine tests, and continue until we’re satisfied with the level of coverage and the thoroughness of our tests.

---

**In summary**:  
- We wrote comprehensive tests in `test_webgraph.py` to cover both normal and exceptional use cases of `webgraph.py`.
- We examined coverage reports to identify which lines and branches were not tested.
- We modified `webgraph.py` to handle uninitialized attributes, provide meaningful exceptions, and ensure consistent behavior across different scenarios.
- We added more tests for missing code paths, including scenarios that trigger exceptions or special conditions, improving our coverage percentage and the overall reliability of our code.
